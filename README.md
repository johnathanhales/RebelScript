# RebelScript

RebelScript is the newest form of the Torvus Batch Script File Builder.

This application will support all of the natch script supporting Bethesda 
Games and Cyberpunk 2077. More games will be added as I discover the batch 
functionality of any more games. The games supported by RebelScript to date are;
- TES V: Skyrim (Van, Leg, SE)
- Fallout 4, 3 and New Vegas
- Cyberpunk 2077 (Must install the CyberTweaksEngine Console Mod)
